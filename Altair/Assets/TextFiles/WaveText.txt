# The layout of the wave info. Each wave is on a new line and the waves are created with this pattern for unit info
# Unit Type (0-2), Number to spawn, Time between spawns, The time the first unit spawns
# Example: For a unit of type 0, that will spawn 3 times, one second apart, and start spawning five seconds after the wave starts
# 0,3,1,5
#
# The wave is created by combining multiple unit info patterns together with ';'
# Example: unitInfo1; unitInfo2; unitInfo3;
